What is a mobile app?

 A mobile website is a website designed, developed, an optimized for mobile devices only.
A mobile app is installable software that runs on mobile devices. Mobile apps user devices 
hardware and software features and usually provide an efficient, more intuitive and seamless user experience


PROS AND CONS:

 
The first advantage of mobile apps is that they are faster than mobile websites. 
They can also access the device or system resources, such as the location or Bluetooth, and can work without Internet access. 

That said, mobile apps can be quite expensive to build and more difficult to maintain when compared to mobile websites. 
Another disadvantage is that for a mobile app to be compatible with different platforms like iOS and Android, it is often required that it be built from scratch. 
It may also be difficult to have your app approved by the App Store if it does not meet specific requirements.

How does a mobile OS work?


The most fundamental software for any smartphone is its operating system (OS). An OS is designed to coordinate communications that occur between the hardware and software resources of mobile devices. Popular platforms such as Android and iOS provide a wide range of software stacks in addition to the built-in OS.

(Mobile operating systems)
A mobile OS typically starts up when a device powers up, displaying different application icons and user interface (UI) elements to users.
The overall experience of the application and adapting, swiping or tapping is managed by the mobile OS.

The function of mobile operating systems
The major function of mobile operating systems is to allow smartphones, tablets, personal digital assistants (PDAs) and other handheld devices to run applications.
The OS provides a channel with which applications can access device resources such as the processor, memory, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and more.
Most of the mobile operating systems in the market are based on open (Android) or closed source (iOS)software.

Popular mobile operating systems

(Android)
Android is a mobile OS released in 2008. You’ll likely find that it is the base OS of most phones and tablets worldwide. 
Android OS is based on a modified version of the Linux kernel and other open-source software. 
It is built primarily for smartphones, Chromebook, Android TV, Android Auto, as well as wearables such as smartwatches.

(iOS)
iOS is Apple’s proprietary OS that runs on the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad. 
iOS gives users a multitouch feel, meaning that all user input is via touch gesturing. 
Through several actions such as swiping, pulling and tapping, users can seamlessly interact with the screen.
With built-in sensors such as gyroscopes and accelerometers, Apple devices allow users to switch between the orientations of applications when tilting the devices.
With the rise in popularity of iOS, developers now have more controls and access to its features.
After the release of iPhone 2.0, Apple also released a software development kit (SDK), which is a set of tools that allows developers to build apps for the OS. 
Due to huge improvements with iPhone OS 3.0, developers were given more power with core location and push notifications. Finally, multitasking was introduced in iOS 4.0.

iOS platforms - iPhones and iPads

Learning objective: Explain various Apple platforms, including iPhones, iPads and wearables.
Over the years, Apple’s operating system has been one of the most preferred operating systems when it comes to mobile devices.
It’s incredible to see how it has conveniently powered millions of devices across the world. 
This operating system is not limited to mobile devices, other non-mobile devices such as TVs, smartwatches, and even cars have been powered by it.



(iPhones)
Every mobile device requires an operating system to function.
As for Apple, they developed iOS which was formerly called iphoneOS to power many of their mobile devices.
This operating system is specifically designed to run only on Apple devices, which means that other non-Apple products will not be able to use it.

Other operating systems such as iPadOS, tvOS, and watchOS that were released later were built from iOS.


(iPadOS) 

iPadOS is a mobile operating system designed to power Apple’s tablets, or iPads.
Developing apps for this type of device is easy. Let’s say you want your existing app to be available to iPad users.
There are various ways you can ensure that your app is responsive when it’s installed on an iPadOS device. 
This way you never have to write the app from scratch.



(MacOS)

macOS, is a Unix based operating system, and is the primary operating system for Apple's Mac computers. 
It was previously called Mac OS X and later changed to OS X. 
In the past few years, this OS has become the second most popular desktop OS, after Microsoft Windows and ahead of ChromeOS.



(WatchOS)

Apple Watch is one of the most popular wearables in the health industry. 
It has helped millions of people achieve their fitness and wellness goals over the years. 
This smartwatch can function with the help of its operating system called watchOS. 
It’s an extension of iOS which powers the popular iPhone. 
The operating system was launched on April 24, 2015, alongside the smartwatch, Apple Watch.
As of today, this is the only device that can run the watchOS.

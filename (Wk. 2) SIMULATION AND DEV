SIMULATORS


What is a Simulator?

A simulator is a computer program that's designed to simulate another kind of device.
Replicating the experience of the original hardware or software by mimicking the behavior of mobile devices. 
Simulators allow you to test how your apps will run on the devices you've designed them for without having to install them on the actual physical devices. 
Simulators do, however, require high computing resources in most cases. 
This means that if you are going to use a simulator on your machine,
it's important to make sure there's enough storage space and random access memory or RAM available for it to run effectively.
